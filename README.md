# Tokenomics Simulator for Collaborative Economy based on Game Theory

## Overview
This repository contains a Python-based tokenomics simulator designed for a collaborative economy environment. This project was inspired by the principles of collaborative economies and aims to provide insights into the dynamics of token-based interactions. The simulator models interactions between borrowers and lenders within a community, tracking the exchange of tokens and various behaviors over time.


## Features
- Simulation of Borrowing and Lending in a token-based economy.
- Customizable Parameters: participants, associations, and initial token distributions.
- Statistical Analysis
- Visualization

## Installation
Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tokenomics-simulator.git
cd tokenomics-simulator
```

## Configuration
The simulation parameters can be adjusted in the parameters.py file, allowing for customization of behaviors, initial token distributions, and other aspects of the simulation environment.

## Output
- Wallet Balance History, to track the balance of tokens in participants' wallets over time.
- Exchanged Tokens History, to log the number of tokens exchanged in each simulation step.
- Borrowing and Lending History, to record the number of borrowing and lending transactions.

## Visualization
The simulator includes tools for visualizing the results of the simulation. Plots and charts are generated to illustrate token distribution, participant behaviors, and overall system dynamics.
